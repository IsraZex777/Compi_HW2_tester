# Compilation Course - Assignment 2 - Tester
This is a collaboratory tester for assignment 2, meaning the test collection is a collective effort of all the students. 

*DISCLAIMER: Currently tests tag parser ONLY!*

# How to run the tester
1. Pull the `tester.ml`, `tp_tests.ml` files and place them together with the project files in the same directory
2. run `ocaml tester.ml`

*IMPROTANT!*
The tester assumes the Tag_Parser module is written in a file named `compiler.ml`
